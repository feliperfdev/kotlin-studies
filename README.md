## Kotlin Studies

A repository created to document my journey while studying Kotlin lang.

### Why I'm  studying Kotlin if I'm a Flutter Developer?

I don't want **just** to be a Flutter Developer at all, I wanna be a **Mobile Developer**. Of course, right now I'm specializing on Flutter, but I feel that I need a more generalist contact/study and profissionalization with other mobile technologies to expand my contacts and knowledge in this area.
